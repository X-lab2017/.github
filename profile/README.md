💡 We like the Unix Philosophy of “**do one thing, and do it well**.”

## 🚀 Learn from a diverse community of professionals with years of experience building OSPOs wordwide



*“There is no broad template for building an open source program that applies across all industries — or even across all organizations in a single industry. That can make its creation a challenge, but you can learn lessons from other organizations ([companies](https://todogroup.org/faq/#should-i-join), [academic institutions](https://todogroup.org/faq/#as-a-university-or-academic-institution-can-i-join-the-todo-group), [governments](https://todogroup.org/faq/#as-a-government-institution-can-i-join-the-todo-group), and more) and bring them together to fit your own organization’s requirements."*


Founded in 2012, the TODO Group is a place to share experiences, develop best practices, and work on common tooling to improve OSPO adoption and education.
